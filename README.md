# to-do-list
My TODO list

"My TODO list" application


I think every junior programmer needs to do this TO LIST.

In this task, I practiced the function in JAVA SCRIPT. I also tried to make the application nicely styled.


Can we :

-add a task

-remove

-edit

-mark as done

Technology: HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT
